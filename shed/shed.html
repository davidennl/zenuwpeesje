                        <p class="post-summary">A third batch of cocoons was messily processed today. For about an hour, a little pan full of soapy water and mushy silk simmers away, filling the air of my studio apartment with the leafy smell of silkworm. Not that any silkworms were harmed in the process! The cocoons' original inhabitants long since vacated the premises, spending their final days fluttering and mating at their heart's content. Still, the cocoons' architecture leaves no doubt as to its creators. It's like being back amongst the silkworms.<br>
                        The silk harvesting process involves more fiddling with scalding water than I'd like, but after being stretched over a little wooden frame, soaked in a special wool soap and then rinsed a final time, the result is glossy silk that's (hopefully) ready for spinning into a proper yarn!<br>I'm still working on a spinning strategy, as my attempts with the drop spindle have been less that ideal. Big names in the industry are being approached for their expertise!</p>
