                    <p class="paragraph">It has come to my attention, following some very concerning conversations with friends, that not everyone was as enthralled by Apple's <em>Pluribus</em> as I was. This is, for lack of a better word, unacceptable. It's shocking and appalling. Did we even watch the same tv series? I was glued to my seat every episode, at once frustrated with the slow plot development and utterly convinced of its purpose.</p> 
                    <p>There's an irony here which tempers my usual hotheadedness about tv a little bit. After all, if <em>Pluribus </em> is about anything, it's friction. The slight discomfort inherent to most human interactions, where we give up a tiny bit of convenience for intimacy to work. In <em>On the Inconvenience of Other People</em>, Lauren Berlant talks about the paradoxical desire to be inconvenienced by others. It is not so much that we enjoy inconvenience, but that being disrupted and encroached upon is the price of connection, which we crave. Perversely, then, we seek out others even though they will inevitably force us into some level of discomfort. Carol, the series protagonist, encapsulates this tension perfectly. She is angry, short-tempered and difficult. Carol dislikes people who enjoy things, sneers at vacationers, and cannot fathom the other survivors not being on board with her big plan of de-Joining as soon as she sets up the meeting. When faced with the possibility of being absorbed into the Joined hivemind, Carol fights for autonomy with every bone in her body, battering a tireless Zosia/Joined to the point of drugging her/them. She is, in short, an incredibly abrasive person.</p>
                    <p>Consequently, the moment she feels her individuality is secure, it makes sense that Carol abandons all contact with the Joined to embrace independence. At first, she attempts to connect with the other survivors again, but these encounters are so grating and awkward that Carol quickly retreats to solitude. The Joined are happy to give her whatever she asks for, albeit via a very annoying voicemail, and so allow her to live out the dream of autonomy, every creature comfort included. Briefly, Carol is ecstatic. No one can inconvenience her. She is free to do and be who she is. And yet, within 40 days, she's so sick of being alone that she begs for the Hive's return, and when Zosia arrives, blandly smiling, she's welcomed with open arms.</p>
                    <p>Like all of us, then, Carol is uncomfortable in the paradoxical state of contact/inconvenience. Perhaps a little more than most, in fact. She despises people, drives them away with her unwillingness to compromise. But Carol is also terribly lonely. Is the price of contact ever worth the discomfort of awkwardness? The clumsiness of communication and negotiation? In the Joined she finds what many of our own universe's people find in chatbots; the dream of contact/convenience. Frictionless contact. Smiling at a mirror.</p>
                    <p>The Joined are focused purely on Carol's desires and needs, bend to her every whim, rarely push back and seek nothing but her happiness. While she ideologically rejects the anaesthetic harmony that binds them into one being, Carol enjoys playing house with Zosia, going so far as to make the hive perform individuality with "I" pronouns. It's as if Helen never died, as if she were somehow improved upon.</p><br>
                    <p class="paragraph">The final episode, of course, gives the lie to that delusion. Carol realises the Joined never stopped plotting her absorption, and that her days as an individual are numbered. She gapes at Zosia, shocked at the fact that&mdash;in its own alien way&mdash;the Joined have a canniness about them. They cannot lie but by omission, and omit they do. The Joined, it turns out, are far from a mirror into which to stare. Convenience and connection cannot coexist, even with them. The season concludes with Carol returning to Manousos, a survivor with whom she's had nothing but friction and disagreement. She gives him an embarrassed shrug, again not quite able to articulate the breadth of Zosia's betrayal. Words do not suffice the way that the electromagnetic frequencies between hive drones do. Carol's only way forward, <em>Pluribus</em> tells us, lies in the inconvenience of other people.</p>
